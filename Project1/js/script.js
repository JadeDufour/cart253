/******************************************************

Game - Chaser
Pippin Barr

A "simple" game of cat and mouse. The player is a circle and can move with keys,
if they overlap the (randomly moving) prey they "eat it" by sucking out its life
and adding it to their own. The player "dies" slowly over time so they have to keep
eating to stay alive.

Includes: Physics-based movement, keyboard controls, health/stamina,
random movement, screen wrap.
